        "\n",
        "Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Reddit's major political and economic subreddits has provided a nuanced view of online political discourse, offering valuable context for understanding user behavior. The analysis delved into various aspects of these online subreddit communities, shedding light on the dynamics of discussions and the interplay of user interests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Preliminary analysis unveiled that `r/Conservative` is the most active subreddit, with the highest number of posts and comments, while `r/AskPolitics` has the most distinct posts and comments, indicating a more diverse user base. The `r/Conservative` subreddit also has the highest average post score, suggesting that its content resonates strongly with its user base. The analysis also revealed that the `r/Conservative` subreddit has the most significant number of users in common with other subreddits, indicating a shared user base and potentially similar ideological leanings. On the other hand, `r/Socialism` and `r/Liberal` subreddits showcase consistent activity, with fewer fluctuations across number of comments and submissions, suggesting a more stable user base.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, weekly patterns of posting activity revealed that Thursdays are the most active days for posting across `r/Liberterian`, `r/Socialism`, and `r/Centrist` subreddits, with the exception of `r/Conservative`, which sees the highest activity on Wednesdays. The analysis also showed that posting activity generally decreases as the year progresses, with the lowest numbers appearing in December. The data also revealed that Saturdays and Sundays consistently have fewer posts than weekdays, in line with typical online engagement trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "To get a better idea of the economics and politics subreddits' similarities, we obtained counts for two curated word lists, one encompassing popular economic events and the other containing recent prominent political figures in the U.S. We found that posts' titles are a better tool to analyze than posts' bodies when searching for these words. This is because the posts' bodies contain links to online news articles, while the posts' titles contain the key words that we are looking for. We also found that the economic subreddits contain a large number of \"shitposts\", related to cryptocurrencies and NFT's, which is why we had to update the word list to account for these words. The political subreddits, on the other hand, do not have a similar distribution of counts across the grouped subreddits, as shown in both Table 3 and Table 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we incorporated U.S GDP data from the FRED API from January 2021 to March 2023 to compare the economic data with the `r/Economics` subreddit posting activity. The analysis revealed that there is a relationship between the state of the economy and the level of engagement and sentiment on the `r/Economics` subreddit. During times of economic uncertainty, there is an increase in the number of submissions and a decrease in the average submission score. This suggests that people are more likely to turn to online communities to discuss and seek information about the economy during difficult times. Additionally, the types of posts that are upvoted during these times suggest that people are looking for content that resonates with their concerns and anxieties.\n",

The subreddit `r/Conservative` shows the most pronounced variability and has the highest peaks, suggesting periods of intense activity which might be attributed to specific political events or discussions that resonated strongly with its user base. It's noteworthy that the peaks for `r/Conservative` sharply spike above all other subreddits, indicating that certain topics or times drove engagement significantly more than usual.\n",

Subreddits like `r/Liberal`, `r/Socialism`, `r/Libertarian`, and `r/Centrist` exhibit moderate activity with fewer fluctuations, reflecting a consistent level of engagement without the sharp spikes observed in the `r/Conservative` subreddit.

        "\n",
        "The subreddits were ranked based on the counts of meaures that correspond with controversial posts and comments. As Figures 1 and 3 have shown already, there is greater number of posts and comments from the `r/Conservative` subreddit, so the counts shown in Table 1 have been normalized. Unsurprisingly, the `r/ChangeMyView` subreddit had the greatest number of distinguished posts and comments (being nearly 2 standard deviations from the mean), which may hint at heavy moderation, potentially as a result of touchy subjects being discussed. Ironically, the subreddits typically associated with the authoritarian left and right on the political compass (`r/Socialism` and `r/Conservative`, respectively) have less distinguished submissions and posts that the libertarian left and right subreddits (`r/Liberal` and `r/Libertarian`, respectively), pointing to an ironic inversion from the expectations of subreddit moderation. Additionally, the `r/Conservative` subreddit had the greatest number of gilded posts and comments. This, at a glance, may seem like users incentivizing each other financially with the prospects of Reddit Gold, which would inevitably promote an echo chamber of ideas in an online political space; however, this doesn't seem to be the case when considering that the subreddit also has the highest count of controversial comments (having a count of over 2 standard deviations from the mean). Instead, this may suggest that users on this subreddit are simply more willing to monetarily support posts and comments that they find appealing.\n",

Based on the distinguished submissions and comments, we can see that among the top 20 controversial users, only one of them (user: \"ultimis\") is a moderator. Another finding is that the top 20 users all come from the subreddits `r/Centrist`, `r/Libertarian`, or `r/Conservative`. Much like the findings from Table 1, Table 2 also seems to suggest that these three political subreddits have a large amount of intra-subreddit discourse among their posts and comments.\n",

        "The dependency wheel depicted in Figure 10 above provides a graphical representation of the shared user base between various political subreddits. The thickness of the connecting bands is directly proportional to the number of users that participate in both subreddits at each end of the band. A notable observation from the wheel is the significant interconnectivity between certain subreddits, which could suggest a shared ideological proximity or an interest overlap among their user bases. For instance, if there is a thick band between the subreddits labeled `r/Liberal` and `r/Socialism`, this would indicate a large common audience, possibly due to similar political leanings or discussions that appeal to both groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the visualization reveals subreddits that serve as common grounds for diverse political discourse, such as `r/ChangeMyView` or `r/AskPolitics`, where the number of interlinking bands suggests a wide range of users from different political backgrounds converging for debate or inquiry. This could imply that these platforms are more neutral or open-ended, attracting a varied audience seeking to engage with multiple perspectives.

The political subreddits utilized for the two tables below are `r/Conservative`, `r/Socialism`, `r/Centrist`, and `r/Libertarian` and the economic subreddits are `r/Finance` and `r/Economics`. Initially, we obtained the counts of three words, `[recession, inflation, and unemployment]`, for the grouped subreddits from regex patterns on the posts' bodies and ran Cosine as well as Jaccard Similarity scores on the counts. The Cosine Similarity score between the grouped subreddits was 0.9 and Jaccard Similarity was 0.04, which meant that the two subreddits have similar distributions of words, even though the counts of individual words were significantly different. This finding culminated in two hypotheses, the first being that the **grouped economic subreddits must be containing a large number of \"shitposts\"**, probably related to cryptocurrencies and NFT's, and the second one that **economics subreddits posts' bodies contain mainly links** to online news articles with the key words present in the post titles. Consequently, we updated the word list to account for `[crypto, blockchain, nft]` words contained in these flippant posts and also ran the similarity algorithms on the posts' titles.\n",

This is because the posts' titles contain the key words that we are looking for, while the posts' bodies contain links to online news articles.

Conversely, this visualization reveals a stark drop in the average score of submissions during the same period of economic concern. This significant downturn in average score might also be interpreted as a barometer of public sentiment towards the economy, rather than simply a measure of post quality. In times of economic uncertainty, it's common for sentiment to sour, and this shift is often reflected in the collective mood of discussions and the types of content that get upvoted. As the real GDP contracted for two consecutive quarters, the mood likely shifted from cautiously optimistic to more pessimistic and critical, leading to a preference for upvoting posts that resonate with the community's concerns and anxieties. However, it is also worth noting that since the number of posts in that period also significantly increased, it is likely that lower post activity (comments/upvotes) could also have impacted the average score during that period."
