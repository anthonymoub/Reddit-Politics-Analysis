# Big Data Reddit Project

The primary objective of this project is to leverage the capabilities of AWS and Azure to analyze millions of Reddit posts pertaining to politics. This endeavor encompasses the entire data science project lifecycle, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning (ML), with PySpark being the principal library utilized.

In this project, the focus was on specific subreddits: r/Conservative, r/Libertarian, r/Liberal, r/Socialism, and r/AskPolitics, along with subreddits related to finance and economics, such as r/Finance and r/Economics. The main aim is to explore the interconnections between politically-oriented subreddits and those centered around economic and financial topics.
